# Read me before proceeding
In this application I have successfully implemented the Foam Tree section, although I faced some challenges along the way:
* For some reason, at first the HTML content wasn't parsed properly and gave me a couple of thousand errors that I have successfully handled.
* I faced another issue with the static/d_images data, which I tried to resolve for many hours, but in the end I could debug it properly.
* Understanding and adding design elements to the the Foam Tree library was quite a challange on its own, but in the end I found no problem with its incorporation.
* Parsing the data to the appropriate format for the Diagram was a bit hard, since it didn't want to accept the foam_tree_data.json file defined as it was with the data inside.

Since I've never used Django I did face some difficulties during these past couple of hours, but in the end it was a valuable experience, thank you for that.
